### Tagging and categorization

This is a system of tags or categorization or markup based on a relational data model. Anything can be tagged
in any way, leaving it up to the end user to only do sensible things. Tags can be grouped, and items can know
their preferred tags.

The system is a web application currently using SQLite.

### Workflow engine

This application uses a fairly recent version of my workflow engine. The workflows are in states.dat
